## important notes

- the pods had conflict, and the conflict resolved by customizing the pods locally (Pods in Pods directory) so the pod isn't part in the GitIgnored and it's not recommended to reinstall the pods.
the proper solution will be having these pods in a local module. untill we do that avoid reinstalling pods.

- the Service and Content App extensions are disable and removed from the build phases for now since they cause issue on running the app on actual devices. so far this not effection the extensions widgets.

- there are files generated by the Swift compiler. These files contain information about the dependencies between Swift source files and are used by the Swift build system to track changes and optimize build times.

they shouldn't be in the project directory itself, and they probably generated due to one of the build phases.
it's safe to remove them. in order to do that you can run the following command on terminal:

rm *.o; rm *.d; rm *.dia; rm *.swiftdeps~; rm *.swiftdeps

- if you facing error such as "Command SwiftCompile failed with nonzero exit code" to the following steps:
1- make sure you signned in for all targets, including the extensions.
2- make sure you using diffrent bundle id for each target.
3- run on actual device.
4- downgrade XCode to 14.2 or lower.
5- make sure you using the same pods I uploaded without making "pod install" or any modification.

if non of these work try to reinstall XCode (14.2 or lower).
